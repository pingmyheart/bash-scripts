## About

Bash Scripts is a repository that contains utility scripts with a unique base script codebase. All the scripts contain an help command
that explain the functionalities of the script itself.

## How it works

It's preferred to use executable version of the script to avoid "bash" before each run.
To make script executable, if it isn't already, use the following command
```bash
chmod +x script-name
```
Each script contains help command that can be get through the following command
```bash
./script-name -h
```
or
```bash
./script-name --help
```
